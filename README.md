# KeeWeb

this is a KeeWeb application developed on pure bash script, as the final project of Unix class.
KeeWeb is a desktop password management solution, you can google it to know about the official software.
I do this project to realize the main functions of the application.

Better run it under linux system, you need to install yad in advance: sudo apt-get install -y yad

run the application by entering command: bash page_login.sh
